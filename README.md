So, This time as a part of Curriculum‚Äôs module 4 project .we were given a task to develop clone of a website named Fraazo (www.Fraazo.com).Fraazo was launched in 2016 as a fresh produce store in the posh locality of Powai with a clear vision of serving the customers with farm-fresh groceries delivered at the doorstep,‚Äù says co-founder Atul Kumar. ‚ÄúWith satisfactory engagement and positive feedback from our customers, we launched our web portal in 2018.

## Start and Difficulties-

We don‚Äôt know each other before so, first each of us have been introduced, we decided to analyze the project, gathered the required tools and techniques to accomplish the task and knowing the ability of each team member. On second day we divided the entire project in the equal amount among all the team members, we also lost some of our files when we try to push on GitHub .Somehow we solved all issues and at last we managed to complete the project before the deadline.
